Senior management reporting directly to the CEOs.  My job was to motivate and
train a team of 20 developers to implement awesome software.  In the meantime,

and guided the executives on new management techniques to get their products
developed sooner and better, by employees who enjoy a balanced life.

  automation using a third party, Selenium automation.
* Created a high-performance bulk email system supporting the flagship survey
  engine application.
* Helped craft policies to benefit the company as a whole, working directly
  with the executives.
* Man, lots of other stuff.  There's not enough room in a resume.

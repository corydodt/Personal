Character Generator for Playtools
=================================

Goals
-----

Meta-chargen: the chargen itself is defined in n3 syntax.  That syntax
specifies the data that will be stored as quoted graphs (formulae) where
we will generate the graphs specified.  The definition of a chargen is, in
part, a definition of its schema.

It is also a definition of the UI to generate this schema.  The interface is
specified by structured triples which provide a series of questions.  The
questions are specified by:

    - question text

    - the schema of the answer

    - the data type of the responses

    - the source data for the responses

Questions can be grouped into sections.  Everything in one section must be
solved before moving on to the next section is possible.

It should be possible to generate the UI in other media by implementing a new
renderer for the responses.

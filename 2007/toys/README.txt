grow.html -
    A very simple, but robust pure-javascript UI.  This toy is designed
    for the "Grow" games at Eyemaze (.. just Google).  Lets you keep
    track of the order of symbols you picked in each game, with an entry
    widget to record the "level" at the end of the game.  Mostly a
    proof-of-concept in JS.

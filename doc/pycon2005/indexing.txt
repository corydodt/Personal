Mike Sallib - indexing patents

Patents suck!
- own lots of patents
- look for patterns that prove sw patents are different
- send to legislators


Getting patents
- full text for 20 years for $30k
- patent stealing @ MIT
40GB database of compressed patent data
- text searching

Xapian.. OSS text indexer in C++ w/ bindings
- 1xwriter many reader
- many kinds of queries
- tagged documents for searching metadata

Xapwrap = wrapper helper for Python
- locking - safety - unicode support - auto flatteners - auto uid mapping -
  tokenizing - improved err handling - i18n stemming - ...

Xapian locks index dirs
- don't specify what process has the lock
- do smarter locking if locking program crashed

xapwrap does Date tokens normalized to iso8601

xapwrap acquires uid's for items you index
. helps automatic index synchronization/voltron indexes

Xapian is fast, small indexes, multiple index grouping voltron
Xapian without xapwrap has problems, unbounded operation times (async
unfriendly), uids munged when grouping indexes, write your own tokenizer

Lucene in pure python was slow

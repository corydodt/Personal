filesystem virtualization - christopher gillett

marketing analytics - recommendations about advertising direction

problem : store files efficiently. lots of non-technical users accessing data
all over the place
- small dev staff, budget
- integrate into existing environment with no work

CFS = user space app, developed with staff of 1
parallel db mgmt = mysql/python
performance? few seconds per transaction, suite runs for hours. realtime apps
that open lots of files might not work well in there

"virtualization": map multiple disparate filesystems into monolithic view so
apps, scripts don't need to worry about physical location of files

common dir structure across all participating fs's

had to work cleanly w/ unix scripts

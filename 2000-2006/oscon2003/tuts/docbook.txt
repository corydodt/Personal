Tools are important

DB is not a word processor, graphic environment, or simple

* Q: conglomerate?
* Q: how do you respond to the statement: "DocBook is a
general-purpose format, where for most applications a tailored XML
format is better because it holds the structure you really care about."

Over 300 tags

Strict structure rules

* Q: tools like livedtd for relax?

Some hierarchical elements like <part> are optional, e.g. things
normally contained in it would be in <book>.

2 sectioning options.. <sect1> <sect2> ... <sect5> or unlimited
section nesting,
e.g. <section><section><section></section></section></section>

<literallayout> - for e.g. poetry; non monospace font but whitespace
is preserved

Q: nbsp?
A: works in XML, but the processor has to deal with it (entity resolution)

"formal displays": have a title/caption, are containers for some
content that illustrates the main text

<mediaobject> has various <imageobjects> which are the format for
different "roles"
* Q: what's the standard way to deal with audio output?
Q: is there agreement for what the "role" attribute should be? 
A: The stylesheet has to agree with currently the only docbook stylesheet.

Q: math?
A: basic solution is to use MathML within a docbook document; later we
will cover namespace/dtd issues

Q: running headers?
A: stylesheet

Q: short title?
A: titleabbrev, shorter version

Customize the DTD so that frex <para> understands the Mathml
container, and the stylesheet recognizes mathml and deals with it.

customization: fill in user-defined templates... use parameters

generated text has been translated, you can use other languages for it
(in common dir)

Q: how do you dump the catalog file?
A: processors have a debug option

parameters? pass them in on the CL using e.g. xsltproc (slide 70)
own stylesheet?  --stringparam html.stylesheet style.css 

slide 72-73.. use driver file, pull in standard docbook with
<xsl:import href="path/to/docbook.xsl"/>, set parameters, replacement
templates, etc.

slide 74 - &#160;==&nbsp;

sagehill book is a good source of info about customizing the stylesheets.

* mention pyana as possible CL processor

Subversion Setup on Windows
===========================

Install the SVN Client
----------------------
Download the client from the Subversion website__.  The file you want will be
whatever the most recent `.exe` file is.

__ http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=91&expandFolder=91&folderID=0

Install it when you have finished downloading it.

Install the Tortoise Client
---------------------------

TortoiseSVN is an explorer extension for working with Subversion.  You can
think of it as the "Subversion GUI".

Download it from the `Sourceforge site`__.  You will want one of the `.msi`
files.

__ http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=138498&package_id=151948

Check to make sure you are installing either the 64-bit version, labeled
"x64", or the 32-bit version, as appropriate.

Reboot when you are finished installing.

Install SSH Client
------------------

This document will describe the procedure for setting up with PuTTY_.
However, SVN, as well as Tortoise, can be used with Cygwin SSH.  The
assumption is that if you have Cygwin SSH already and prefer it, you will be
able to follow the Unix instructions to set it up.

Download and run the PuTTY installer_ to get started.

.. _PuTTY: http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/

.. _Installer: http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty-0.58-installer.exe

Create a New PuTTY Private Key
------------------------------

   :align: right

With PuTTY installed, you will have a PuTTY menu under your Start menu.  Start
by opening PuTTYgen, and:

1. Click Generate

2. Move your mouse around in the blank space until the progress bar fills
   completely.

3. Click "Save Private Key".  The default location should be your User Profile
   directory (aka your HOME directory on Windows.)  Save it there, with the
   name `putty.ppk`.  If it asks you to confirm saving with no password, click
   `OK`.

4. **Leave the puttygen window open.**  You will need it in a later step.

Create a New PuTTY Session
--------------------------

.. image:: images/puttymenu_putty.png
   :align: right

Now launch PuTTY from the Start menu.

In the "PuTTY Configuration" window that opens:

1. Type in "zoobody.com" as Host Name.

2. Type in "zoobody.com" under Saved Sessions.  This name is important, make
   sure to type in exactly "zoobody.com".

3. Click "Save" and see that your new `zoobody.com` session shows up in the
   list under Saved Sessions.

Set the Session to Use Your Private Key
---------------------------------------

.. image:: images/puttycategory.png
   :align: left

4. In the tree on the left, click Connction > Data.  Fill in your zoobody.com
   shell account name for "Auto-login username".

5. In the tree on the left, go down further to Connection > SSH > Auth.

6. "Browse..." for your "Private key file for authentication."  Select
   the `putty.ppk` which you created earlier.

7. **Go back up to Session in the tree on the left, and click Save again.**
   It is easy to forget to do this.

Open zoobody.com . . .
----------------------

1. With your zoobody.com session still there, click Open.  You should get a
prompt asking for your password.  Type in your password.

2. You should now have a shell prompt.  Type the following::

    mkdir .ssh
    chmod 700 .ssh
    cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys

The shell will now be waiting for you to type something. . .

. . . and Paste Your Public Key
-------------------------------

.. image:: images/puttygen_hl.png
    :align: right

3. Now, *bring your PuTTYgen window back up*.  Select all the text in the area
labeled "Public key for pasting into ...", and copy it to the clipboard with
`Control+C`.

4. *Go back* to the PuTTY shell window.  Right-click, which will paste your
clipboard.  Press `Control+D` to save it.

5. Type: `chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys`

You can now close the PuTTYgen window that you had open from before.  You can
also close the PuTTY shell window.

Test That You Can Login With No Password
----------------------------------------

Open PuTTY from the Start menu once again.

.. image:: images/puttymenu_putty.png

Double-click the `zoobody.com` session.

You should get a shell prompt immediately, without it asking for your
password.

Test TortoiseSVN
----------------

You have now successfully configured PuTTY, so give yourself a pat on the
back, and test it:

Right click on the Desktop, and select "SVN Checkout..." We will check out
your sandbox.  *Assuming your username is "somedeveloper", do the following*:

1. In the field at the top, type in `svn+ssh://zoobody.com/zoobody/sandbox/somedeveloper`

2. Add "\\somedeveloper" to the end of the second field so it reads
`C:\\...\\Desktop\\somedeveloper`.

Click OK, and say OK when it asks if you want a new directory.  If it tells
you what revision you checked out, Subversion is installed and configured
correctly.

Appendix: Using Cygwin SSH with Tortoise
----------------------------------------

If you prefer Cygwin SSH, but you also want to use TortoiseSVN, you can:

1. Right click on the Desktop

2. TortoiseSVN menu > Settings

3. Click Network in the tree on the left

4. "Browse..." for the ssh executable, which will be `C:\\cygwin\\bin\\ssh.exe`,
   and click OK.

Like PuTTY, Cygwin SSH should be configured to use a public/private key so you
won't get prompted for passwords every time you use Subversion.

Tada

You are finished__.

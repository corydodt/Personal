cross platform desktop apps w/ Python - Nathan Yergler @ Creative Commons

macos, win32, linux

wx initially?

ccPublisher - 1 code base, 1 XML file (ant), 6 build scripts, 3 platforms, 1
developer

why wx?
- runs on win, mac, linux
- lots of shared code
- native l&f
- extensible toolkit and find support

robin dunn working on osx wx issues for osaf

app developed with xrc (xrced with distribution)
. i18n for free
. don't use gridbagsizer! bugs on win32, osx. nested gridsizers instead
. staticbitmap paths may change. there's a workaround, add a placeholder
  panel getting replaced

packaging
. distutils hork
. windows and mac distutils are the suck
. two-phase build on win/mac instead:
  . freeze
  . build distribution

freezing:
. py2exe on win32
  . build multiple exe's with a single pass
  . use windows and consoles options to set scripts
  . any unicode, include the encodings package
  . stuff goes in dist dir
. py2app on osx (svn head version works well)
  . 

distribution:
. on win32, he uses wix opensource for msi's
  . xml-based config file for components
  . two guids, one global (life of the app) and one for each version
  . generating guid, env variables can be automated
  . py2exe doesn't copy visual c++ 7 dll's
. on py2app
  . new bundlebuilder
  . disk images preferred
  . apple has a tool for that: hdiutil create -srcfolder $SOURCE $DESTNAME
. both are forgiving



cross-platform wishlist:
. higsizer (calculate based on human interface guidelines)
  . he's working on
. python port/distutils task for wix
. distutils data files that don't suck
. variable substituion for xrc files (fix for staticbitmaps?)


conclusion:
. scripts, woo

q/a

. layout on osx frustrating
. on linux .. needs more experience. cx_freeze an option
. automated gui testing==email to staff :-)

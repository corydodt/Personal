Brian learned Java and PHP (loser) but liked Python (rox0r)

Hockey!

too many frameworks
want to avoid pushing people to Java and PHP with too many options
"Ruby on Rails"
- mixed reviews
- why is it good?

Webware, Quixote, CherryPy, Twisted, Zope, Karigell, CGI (control)


Michelle's Methodology
- test new user's perspective (not perfect code)
- blog
- commit to public repo

Webware: middlekit (persistence), webkit (requests), *?kit
++es: widgets

Durus - quick to hook up to persistence
        no session concept?

Quixote- cleaner code at the end, steep learning

CherryPy- python/templates.
    templates: <py-for="user in users">
    better persistence

Twisted- awesome for Practical Internet Groupware
    Twisted + Nevow + Atop

pythoncard - kevin altis

build an application from scratch
pythoncard != hypercard
more like vb
pycard 1.0 sometime this year - with wxpython 2.6
pycard 2.0 might be very different

build an application

pycard includes tools, framework, sample apps (~50)
. everything built w/ pythoncard
. very simple app

app on mac: mortgage calculator
. pythoncard gui
. resource editor
. grab a template from sample templates
. app w/ file/exit menu
. save as directory
. names are identifiers
. new field, amount
. new field, rate
. new calculate button
. new statictext labels for fields
. for each field: properties, font, change to make bigger
. align components to grid option
. statictext field for the result (html window another option)


(editing python code in pycrust)
PythonCard.model.Background is the main app class
on_initialize event
on_calculate_mouseClick for handling the field
used pyfi to calculate amortization

on_initialize is an event at the app startup
. use it to force the caculate to happen at startup with the default field values

runtime tools
. shell
. resource editor
. code editor
. message watcher (show events)
these can be embedded in the pythoncard app you're writing itself.. you can
have them start up when it does in a separate window
